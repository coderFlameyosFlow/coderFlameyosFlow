## About ME
- üëã Hello, I‚Äôm @coderFlameyosFlow!
- I am a 13 year old developer that loves to develop minecraft plugins and intermediete necessities.
- I'm currently forwarding to learn SQL at first, the C family (C, C++, C#) at second, and web development (HTML, CSS) at last in the future!

Here are my **SKILLS** and their priorities:
- Java and Kotlin, and my priorities are bukkit/spigot/paper development and database.
- MongoDB, and my priorities are all programming languages I know.
- Python, and my priorities are discord bot development
- Nextcord, a python fork of discord.py to help create discord bots!

What operating system do I use? 
- I use **Vanilla Arch Linux with XFCE**

What IDES do I use?
- **Intellij IDEA** Community
- **PyCharm** Community
- **Visual Studio** Code

Programming journey?
Throughout my programming journey, **I've been a VERY fast learner in terms of JVM** (Thanks to python speeding up my basic learning with stuff such as OOP).

As of now I know:
- Reflection
- Intermediate level Java (stable, clean, performant and optimized code)
- Bukkit, Spigot and Paper Server APIs, and Velocity Proxy APIs (That excludes NMS)
- Popular APIs such as Vault API
- How to write clean and optimized code
- Experience with K2 Compiler (Kotlin new compiler)
- Aikar's flags and Open J9 (Java)
- HikariCP for SQL instead of java.sql

I'm most likely learning other big things as you're reading this

How can you reach me?
- You may reach me via my discord at **FlameyosFlow#2691**. üëç

Do you have any projects?
- Most of my projects are private, although you can check my public projects on my github pinned.
